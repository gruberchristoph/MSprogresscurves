Title: Processed mass spectrometry data - systematic identification of allosteric effectors in Escherichia coli metabolism

Description: MATLAB files of processed mass spectrometry data, i.e. full data table after peak picking, annotation and quantification. Additionally, for each of the tested enzymes, the relevant ion traces of substrates and products are extracted, sorted by timepoint and replicate and saved in separate tables.
